# Unlock Profits with E-Commerce Sales Data
### Amazon India: Profitability & Returns (Mar–Jun 2022)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon India’s e-commerce sales from March to June 2022 to identify opportunities for improving profitability and minimizing return-related losses. Using Excel and Tableau, we conducted a full data cleaning process, developed revenue KPIs, and visualized insights through a strategic Tableau Story.

**Business Objective:**  
Uncover patterns in sales, product performance, regional demand, and return behavior — then recommend data-backed strategies to optimize revenue and reduce losses.

## Data Cleaning Summary
The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared in Excel with the following key steps:

- Removed irrelevant columns (`Fulfilled By`, `Promotion ID`, `Unnamed`)
- Standardized currency formatting using INR (₹) prefix
- Filtered out blank or error-filled rows
- Flagged and categorized return types (damaged, rejected, lost in transit)
- Validated final dataset in `.xlsx` format for Tableau import

*Outcome:* A clean, analysis-ready dataset structured for profit and return analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We created 7 Tableau story slides to drive actionable insights:

| Slide | Focus Area | Key Insight |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Executive Summary | Project Overview | Returns eroding profit; peak in April revenue |
| 2. Revenue by Month | Trend Analysis | Revenue peaked in April, declined after |
| 3. Revenue by Category | Product Performance | Apparel, shoes dominate sales + returns |
| 4. Top-Selling Styles | SKU-Level Insight | Small number of styles drive majority of sales |
| 5. Returns by Category | Return Risk Zones | Footwear, electronics = high return volume |
| 6. Return Types (Pie) | Root Causes | Damaged goods & rejections dominate returns |
| 7. Revenue by State | Regional Strategy | Maharashtra, Karnataka lead sales concentration |
| 8. Strategic Recap | Call to Action | Targeted strategies for profit & retention lift |
