## 🧼 Data Cleaning Process (Excel)

### ✅ Files Used:
- `Amazon Sale Report.csv` → cleaned to `Cleaned_Amazon_Sales_Data.xlsx`

### 🔍 Steps Taken:
| Step | Action | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Deleted irrelevant columns (`Fulfilled By`, `Promotion ID`, `Unnamed`) | Columns provided no business value or variation |
| 2 | Extended all column widths | To display hidden date values (Excel was showing `######`) |
| 3 | Verified date ranges | Ensured all orders were within Mar–Jun 2022 scope |
| 4 | Formatted Revenue | Set to `Currency (Custom)` with `₹` prefix for INR |
| 5 | Checked for blank rows and dropped any without critical values | Prevent calculation errors in Tableau |
| 6 | Verified uniqueness of Order ID | Ensured valid count of total orders |
| 7 | Flagged return-related statuses for later segmentation | Used for return volume/type insights |

**Outcome:** Clean, structured dataset ready for Tableau analysis.

## 📊 KPI Development

| KPI | Formula | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Total Revenue | SUM([Order Amount]) | Core profitability metric |
| AOV | SUM([Order Amount]) / COUNTD([Order ID]) | Measures order value trends |
| Total Orders | COUNTD([Order ID]) | Baseline activity |
| Return Rate | Return Orders / Total Orders | Assesses operational efficiency |

All metrics formatted in Tableau using `Currency (Custom)` for ₹ and % as needed.

## 📈 Tableau Visuals

### Story Slides Created:
1. **Executive Summary** – Project goals, key findings, and recommendations
2. **Revenue by Month** – April peak, followed by decline → need for retention campaigns
3. **Revenue by Category** – Apparel & shoes dominate → bundle & upsell strategy
4. **Top-Selling Styles** – 80/20 distribution → highlight and pair with slower SKUs
5. **Returns by Category** – Shoes & electronics return-heavy → improve fulfillment
6. **Return Types (Pie)** – Damage/rejection dominate → operational fixes needed
7. **Top States by Revenue** – Urban concentration → geo-targeting & regional expansion
8. **Strategic Recap (Text Only)** – Clear call to action for business impact

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Revenue Growth | Use remarketing, bundles, and price tests |
